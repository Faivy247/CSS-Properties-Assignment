<!--<h1>First Section</h1>-->
<p style="color: green;"> <b><i>I am Oluchi Igboke. I have had this secret love for technology, 
    but I felt I wasn't cut out for it. I had the courage to start learning coding when a friend 
    of my began the journey and shared her experiences with me. They were wonderful experiences. 
    I got the courage to search for information for personal growth. It was during my search that 
    I stumbled on this scholarship. I don't take this opportunity lightly. I will give it my all 
    and make the best out of it</b></i></p>

    <!--<h2>Second Section</h2>-->
    <p ID="one" style="color: red;"><b><i>My journey here started with HTML basis. I understand that HTML provides the structure of 
        every webpage. It is used to deliver content on the webpage, including tables and forms. 
        The CSS, also known as the Cascading Style Sheet, is the styling language program for webpages. 
        It adds form and style to the html structure. The CSS syntax is different from the HTML syntax. 
        The CSS has different selectors that it uses to assign styles to HTML elements. CSS is more 
        complex compared with HTML and I am still getting the hang of it. I believe I will conquer 
        in the end.</i></b></p2>

    <!--<h3>Third Section</h3>-->

    <p ID="two" style="color: blue"><b><i>Padding, margins and borders are all elements that are used to describe the Box model of CSS. 
        Padding refers to the space that is between HTML elements and its border. This space is classified 
        into left, right, bottom and top. The margin refers to the property that specifies the space around 
        an HTML element, while a border is the property that is sued to specify the elemtn border, its color
